    <h1>Who am I 💳?</h1> 
    <p>
        Hi ✋ I’m Hamza Errechydy,
<br>
        English major student 👨‍🎓 (first year). 
<br>
        On the side I do a load of stuff (boring things but I love them ❤️) :
<ul>
    <li>I took online courses 💻 : currently it’s the odin project, a web development course in ruby and JavaScript.</li>
    <li>I read books 📚 : just finished This is marketing by Seth Godin, now it’s On writing on well.</li>
    <li>I learn French 🇫🇷</li>
    <li>I learn German 🇩🇪</li>
    <li>I read articles 🗞 : now Paul graham essays.</li>
    <li>I listen to podcasts 🎙 : indie hackers is the current obsession.</li>
    <li>I watch YouTube videos and TED talks 📺 to learn more about tech, design and business.</li>
    <li>Recently I started using Twitter and LinkedIn 📱 to learn social media marketing, branding and develop new relationships.</li>
    <li>And I am building this community 💎</li>
</ul>
    </p>
    

<h1>What is this 🧐?</h1> 
<p>
    I found out that college is not a place where you can gain experience that you will need after graduation to get a good job and start the career you want, so I decided to build this online community to help each other as students, expand our knowledge, develop skills and connect with new people.
</p>

<h1>Why should I care 😒?</h1> 
<p>
    I am sailing in the same boat you are in, we are all students here, we share the same pain, dream, desire, goal, struggle, situation, ... a group of like minded people you can join today!
</p>

<h1>How can I use this 🧰?</h1>
<p>
    This is an MVP, this page is the only available content, great things are coming, stay tuned 🚀.
</p>

<h1>Can I help 👷‍♂️?</h1> 
<p>
    You are more than welcome 🥳,
<br>
    If you can: write, design, code, talk, ... or anything helpful to the community.
